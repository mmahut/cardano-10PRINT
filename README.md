  Cardano-10PRINT generated using the nonce of epoch 258

## The purpose

This simple piece of code has been created as part of the [public assertion of randomness](https://iohk.io/en/blog/posts/2021/03/29/the-secure-transition-to-decentralization/) during epoch 258 of the Cardano mainnet, infusing entropy to secure the future of the blockchain running the Ouroboros protocol.

The picture that has been generated using the nonce of epoch 258, shown above, has been included both as [a picture](https://adastat.net/transactions/303314cacc082691c68ea8912a365e7128cc0f6ae7b6773b7b96d45870c7ff03) and [the code](https://adastat.net/transactions/8174d9f80d9d35f39e8856f2e6b26c4623409af46423f58bf54628962cedc837) that has been used to generate it, on the Cardano blockchain as a transaction metadata.

Every epoch, a new picture can be generated, using the fresh nonce, that has included the previous artworks. The endless cycle, the beauty of recursion.
